# Nango

NextJs & Django had a baby! It's Nango!

This blueprint under steroids speeds up the development of your full stack application by providing a ready-to-use template and automatically builds the bridge between the frontend & backend.

The bridge contains:

- drf serializers
- drf endpoints
- backend routes
- front types
- api call methods

The workflow is simple: 
1. Create a model in your backend
2. Run the `make bridge` command
3. Import type and api call method in your frontend
